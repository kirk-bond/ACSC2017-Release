## Instructions to Contestant

Situation:  You're trying to log into the computer network but the security
system only allows other computers to log in (no humans allowed).  Prove to the
system that you're not a computer by answering a bunch of math questions
quickly and get into the system.

## Solution:

This problem requires scripting.  Basically you need to have a script that
looks for the problem to be displayed, evalute the problem, and then answer it
and repeat
