It looks like all of the parts of a flag are sitting there but what does it all mean?


Hint:  It doesn't really look encrypted, just jumbled


# Solution:  This is a simple rail-fence cypher which transposes characters in a weave patter.  I used http://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher to go ahead and put this together.  Make sure you click to box to use punctuation.  This particular cipher has a depth of 5 and translates out to:  This is a bunch of filler text that means absolutely nothing to you or to me. I am going to bury the flag right here though.  acsc2017{we_go_up_and_down}  Did you see the flag or did it get lost in here too?
