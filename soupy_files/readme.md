# Instructions to Contestant
Situation:  The year is 2019 and you're a blade runner.  You have recieved a report that there is a replicant has managed to get themself employeed at Tyrell.  Unfortuantely the details are slim and your little eye machine is out of action (parts have been on order for over a year).  So, you're forced to take the little bit of infomration that you have on the likely replicant and go through the Tyrell personnel records and find them.  Unfortunately, Tyrell is still partying like its 1899 and isn't using a database system and instead has a simple page with information for each person on it.

What do we know?

Today is 3/12/2036
Replicants generally have a 4 year life span
Female
Between 5'6 and 5'8
Red Hair
Brown Eyes

Hint:  4 year life span means it must have been working for the company for less than 4 years

# Setup:  Unzip the contents of the zip file into a web directory to be served up

# Solution:  This challenge is trying to get you to script an examination of the web files and using some simple logic to find the correct personel file.  An examination of the files will find that mya7ulrXd2am.html meets all of the conditions layed out above.
