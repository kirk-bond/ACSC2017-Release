# Instructions to contestant
Innovative Online Industries (IOI) is trying to figure out where Wade lives so that they can make him an offer he can't refuse.  Unfortunately, the only real clue that they currently have is this photo that he posted on his profile.  What street does he live on?

Note:  Enter the flag as acsc2017{<roadname>}.  Do not include the road description (rd, st, dr, etc)  

# Solution:  If you view the exif data on the photo you will find the lat/long of where it was taken.  Put those into google maps and it will put the arrow on Oakdale Dr.
