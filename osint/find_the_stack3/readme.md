# Instructions to Contestant

Once again, need to find the stack but this time, we're not looking for an address at all. Find the normal flag (acsc2017{######})


# Solution:  If you notice, on this one compared to the other two times this image was used, the file name is significantly different.  The file is named that way because they were saved directly from Flick.com.  You can read an article about Flickr's naming convention at https://www.bram.us/2008/01/12/my-priceless-flickr-tip-how-to-find-the-original-flickr-photo-url-and-user-from-a-static-flickr-image-url/.  If you go to http://flickr.com/photo.gne?id=36912733824 it will direct you to it's oringal page and in the comments is the flag acsc2017{FindOtherSources}
