Yet another QR Code type challenge from me!

This one has bunch of crap QR, a Rick Roll QR, one DotCode, and a password protected Zip file.  The DotCode has the password for the zip.  The zip has a false flag with a free hint, and a Codablock F code.

Tools I used (not all inclusive of how it can be done):
iOS Tool called "Scanner" (https://itunes.apples.com/us/app/manatee-works-barcode-scanner/id504201315?mt=8)
Windows tool called "Barcode Reader Firmware" free trial https://bytescout.com/download/web-installer

Candidates will sift through the Flags of the World folder.  I used the iOS Scanner tool to decode the dotcode in flag13.jpg
* decodes as === teh c0dez r in teh dotz ===

This is the password to unzip the MoarCodez.zip.

The zip file spits out a folder named test with a flag.txt and crossword.gif
* flag.txt is a hint file for the obscure barcode contained in crossword.gif.
* The barcode is codablock F
  * Barcode Reader Firmware can decode it
  
Hint for engine:  dotcode, codablock F, Scanner, CortexScan.  Take ~70% available points for the hint.

Flag is: acsc2017{a_little_like_last_year_is_ok}
